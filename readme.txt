== Description ==

HelloToken is a clean and easy way to monetize your website. HelloToken works by asking your readers a question in exchange for article access. Anytime one of your readers answers a question, you earn 3 cents. It's FREE to use; in fact, we pay you!

We only ask one question at a time and you can customize the reader experience:

Add your own logo, blog name and color to the question box (via our website).
Select exactly which articles HelloToken questions show up on.
Choose how much content readers can access before seeing a question.
Pick whether the question is mandatory or optional for your readers.

After you install the plugin, head to our website and create an account. HelloToken is currently in a closed beta, so once you create an account, you will be added to a waitlist. Our team is hard at work approving publishers and will be in touch with you after you sign up. Once the process is complete, you will be able to see analytics on how readers interact with HelloToken on your website. 

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/hellotoken` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
3. Use the Settings->HelloToken screen to configure the plugin and add your Client ID (obtained from your HelloToken.com profile page)
4. Activate HelloToken on desired posts and pages through the WordPress bulk edit feature.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Do I qualify as a publisher? =

Right now we're only available on the wordpress.org platform as a closed beta. If you're running on wordpress.org, then sign up and fill out your publishing details. We'll take a look and if you seem like a good fit, we'll bring you on board! Currently, you must have 10,000 hits per month at a minimum to join. 

= So how do I use this thing? =

Once you're a verified account, you'll a receive a client ID in your account settings. Use it and closely follow this guide to set up HelloToken on your WordPress site. Fill out your domain in your account settings (and optionally provide a site logo), and you should start seeing questions appear on your site! You can track the number of responses for your articles by visiting your dashboard. (See this page for more details: http://blog.hellotoken.com/2015/04/06/26/)

= The most important question: how do I get paid? =

Once you hit our minimum of $20 in earnings, you can click our pay-out button on your hellotoken.com dashboard to receive money! Right now we payout directly to PayPal accounts--you'll need a valid account to receive money. We're working to expand to other options, so drop us a message if there's a payout option you'd like to see! 

= I need money now, but the payout button won't appear! =

Due to processing fees, we require a $20 minimum before you can payout. Use your response tracker to make sure you've hit the requisite number of responses first! 

= I paid out, but something went wrong and I didn't get any money. =

Remember to provide accurate details to PayPal and check your PayPal account to verify that you can accept transfers. Any payouts still uncollected after 30 days will be refunded to your HelloToken account. If any other errors occur, please contact support and we'll work with you to resolve the payout. 

= I want to payout but HelloToken is telling me I have unresolved payouts? =

For your security, we request that you resolve all payouts in your PayPal account from HelloToken before making any other payouts. 

= Other questions =

If you have any other questions, you can email us at contact [at] hellotoken.com. If you require support, you can email us at support [at] hellotoken.freshdesk.com. You can also find more information on our website at hellotoken.com.

b) “Redirect Type” – if a user closes the HelloToken question, you can either let them still get to the article, redirect them to your homepage, or redirect them to another site.

If we don’t have any questions in our database, no questions show up on your activated site normally (unchecked). Check this option to test if HelloToken is working on your site. Just remember to turn it off!

d) “Free Content Count” – how many articles readers can access before being served a HelloToken question.

e) “Paywall show delay” – seconds after accessing the article before a user encounters a HelloToken question.
